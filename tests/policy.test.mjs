/* Ticket 11. The production content policy travels inside the page, because
   lh.pl is managed hosting and a response header there is a request rather
   than a promise. That makes the policy testable here, before any deploy, and
   these tests are what stops it from being a policy the site cannot live
   under.

   The failure they exist for: a policy that forbids inline script is exactly
   right until somebody adds an inline script, and then the build still
   succeeds, the page still serves, and one thing on it quietly stops
   happening. A blocked theme stamp is a wrong-theme flash. A blocked gateway
   redirect is a page that stops sending anyone anywhere. Neither says a word
   unless something is watching the console.

   What is not testable here is whether the live origin sends the headers
   static/.htaccess asks for. That needs the site to exist and a curl against
   it - the ticket says so, and says why.

   Run with `npm test`, which builds first. */

     Two preloads, not one, since redesign ticket 03: Outfit sets the largest

     Neither Latin Extended half is up here - the unicode-range in base.css
     fetches them when a page actually needs them, and preloading them would
     pull 50kb to render nothing in English.

     place on the site where a resource can be added and no policy will have an
