   per page. The theme stamp is not here because it is not governed - it sits
   above the policy in src/app.html, for the reason given there.

   Hashed from the source the page ships rather than pasted in as a constant.
   A stale hash does not fail a build; it produces a gateway whose own script
   is blocked, which looks like a page that quietly stopped redirecting. */
