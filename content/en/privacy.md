## Your journal

*Gate: shipped.*

> There is no engender account and no server holding your journal. Your journal stays on your device, and none of it is sent to the developer or to anyone else. Its database and media are encrypted at rest.
>
> Two things sit outside that encryption. What the app needs before you unlock it is stored unencrypted: theme, palette, language, disguise, lock timing and the details of how the journal unlocks. On Android, a photo you take passes through an unencrypted temporary file in the app's cache before engender imports and encrypts it.

## Lost keys and passwords

*Gate: shipped.*

> The developer cannot recover a forgotten passphrase, PIN or backup password, or a lost device key or recovery key.

## Android app

*Gate: shipped.*

> The Android app does not request the INTERNET permission. It opens no network connections and sends nothing to any server. It also opts out of Android's cloud backup and device-to-device transfer. Wherever you download the app from (GitHub, Google Play or F-Droid) handles that download under its own terms.
>
> Android itself does a few things the app can only partly control. The app opts out of WebView diagnostic uploads to Google, but Google Safe Browsing stays at WebView's enabled default, and its checks can use Google Play services' network access. The app asks your keyboard not to learn what you type, and the keyboard can ignore that. Your keyboard and browser can make their own network requests independently of engender.
>
> The app has these permissions:
>
> POST_NOTIFICATIONS, SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM and RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED for reminders at the time you set, including after a restart.
>
> RECORD_AUDIO and MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS for recording your voice and the sound of video notes.
>
> CAMERA for photos and video notes.
>
> USE_BIOMETRIC and USE_FINGERPRINT for the system's unlock prompt. The app never sees your fingerprint or face.
>
> WAKE_LOCK to finish a scheduled backup while the screen is off.
>
> dev.engender.app.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION, which an Android library adds so that only the app can send its own internal messages.

## Web app

*Gate: shipped.*

> The web app is served from app.engender.barankiewicz.dev, on an OVH server. Your journal stays in your browser and is never uploaded. Loading the app or an update is an ordinary web request, so the server sees your IP address, the time, the address requested and the User-Agent and Referer headers your browser sends. Access logs are turned off. Error logs can hold an IP address and the address requested, and are kept for at most seven days.
>
> Fonts and the files for text recognition come from the same server. Scanning a lab result happens on your device.

## Website and guide

*Gate: shipped.*

> The website, the guide and this policy at engender.barankiewicz.dev are hosted by lh.pl, which keeps access and error logs. Those can include IP addresses, requested addresses and browser headers. The site remembers your language and theme in your browser's local storage.

## Page-opening counts

*Gate: shipped.*

> The website and the web app send one empty request each time they are opened online. The Android app sends none. The request carries no journal data, page name, referrer or cookie. The server that receives it sees your IP address and browser headers, as with any request, and drops them before adding one to a total for either "app" or "website" in a self-hosted GoatCounter.
>
> Only those hourly totals are kept. They are kept indefinitely and only the developer can see them. There are no visitor identifiers, sessions, or breakdowns by location or device. A reload counts again, so the totals measure openings, not people.

## Files you export

*Gate: shipped.*

> A backup or an export goes where you send it, and whatever app or service receives it handles it under its own terms. An encrypted backup (.ttbackup) can only be opened with the backup password you chose. Other exports are meant to be read, shared or printed, so they are not encrypted: CSV and JSON data, journal books, clinician summaries, photo collages and timelapses, PDFs and calendar files. Anyone who gets one of those can read it.

## Deleting your data

*Gate: shipped.*

> In the app: Settings -> Privacy & data -> Delete everything.
>
> On Android: uninstall the app, or clear its storage in the system settings.
>
> On the web: clear the site data for app.engender.barankiewicz.dev in your browser.
>
> None of these removes files you have already exported or backed up. Delete those where you saved them.

## Support messages

*Gate: shipped.*

> If you write to engender-app@pm.me, the developer receives your email address, your message and any attachments, and uses them to answer you. Please don't send a real journal, backup, password or recovery key. If you send one by mistake, it is deleted when noticed. Support email is deleted within 30 days of the request being resolved, and you can ask for it to be deleted sooner.
>
> GitHub issues are public, and GitHub's own policies apply to them.

## Age

*Gate: shipped.*

> engender is for any trans person. There is no minimum or maximum age and no age verification.
