> You never need to send journal content, a backup file or a key to get help.

## The short version

*Gate: shipped.*

> There is no engender account or server holding your journal. Your journal stays on your device unless you export or share it. Its database and media are encrypted at rest. The developer cannot recover it for you.
>
> The website and hosted web app count online page openings without visitor profiles. These counts contain no journal data. Android sends no counts: it is 100% local.

## What the app stores, and where

*Gate: shipped.*

> Everything you enter stays in the app's storage on your device: entries, notes and moods, scales, doses and regimens, lab results, appointments, referrals and waiting lists, notes on the people you see, costs, name and document changes, milestones, letters, photos, voice and video recordings, documents you import, reminders and your settings. The journal database and your photos are encrypted at rest. NONE of it is sent to the developer or to anyone else.
>
> Some preferences needed before unlocking, including theme, palette, language, disguise and lock timing, are kept outside the encrypted journal. On Android, the camera app temporarily writes a photo to an unencrypted cache file before engender imports and encrypts it. Encryption at rest does not mean that every temporary file or preference is encrypted.
>
> The web app and the Android app keep separate journals. To move a journal from one to the other, you export an encrypted backup and import it. The app cannot sync a journal between two devices over your local network. On Android even a local connection needs the INTERNET permission, which the app does not request. Two Android phones can instead share a backup folder, as described under Encrypted backups.

## Hosted web app

*Gate: shipped.*

> The web app is served from app.engender.barankiewicz.dev. When your browser loads the app or checks for an update, the server sees the ordinary details of each request:
>
> your IP address,
>
> the time of the request,
>
> the requested URL, including any query string, and the response size,
>
> the User-Agent and Referer headers your browser sends.
>
> The app server runs on an OVH VPS. Routine access logs are disabled. Error logs can contain an IP address and requested URL; the live server keeps them for at most seven days. Page-count requests are not logged.
>
> The app does not upload your journal or create an account or visitor profile. Page-opening counts are described below. Fonts and text recognition files come from the same server. Installing the web app downloads the complete English and Polish OCR engine before it is ready offline. Scanning happens on your device, including the first scan after installation.
>
> Android includes the English and Polish text recognition files in the APK. Its first lab scan needs no download or network connection.
>
> Journal text fields ask the browser to turn off autofill and session restoration for their contents. This does not remove text saved by earlier app versions or control what a browser extension or your keyboard stores.
>
> On the web, the local journal opens in one of four ways:
>
> A passphrase you type, turned into a key with Argon2id.
>
> A four-digit PIN, combined with a key tied to this browser profile.
>
> Biometric verification on browsers that support the WebAuthn PRF extension (Touch ID, Windows Hello or your device lock).
>
> A key kept in this browser profile, which opens the journal without asking.
>
> PIN, biometric and device-bound access depend on keys held in that browser profile. Clearing the site's data, resetting the browser profile or losing the device makes that copy of the journal unreadable.
>
> You can also make an optional 25-character recovery key. It opens the journal on the same device and browser profile if your passphrase, PIN or biometric authenticator stops working. It cannot move data to a new device or open an export. The app shows the key once, when you make it, and keeps only a sealed copy of the journal key. The one exception is a lock: if the app locks while a new key is on screen, it shows the same key again after you unlock. Until then the key is held encrypted in memory and is never saved. A new key replaces the old one only when you confirm you have written it down, and until then both open the journal. If the app closes before that, the old key keeps working and the app tells you the replacement did not finish. Keep the recovery key on paper or in a password manager on another device: anyone with it and the journal data can read the journal. It cannot bring back deleted data.
>
> Creating or replacing a recovery key and changing access mode require the current PIN, passphrase or biometrics again. Web device-bound mode has no current secret, so its confirmation explains that the unlocked browser can make these changes. Android unlocked mode requires biometrics or the existing recovery key; without either, the change is unavailable. A recovery unlock approves one immediate protection setup, not other changes in Settings. These checks happen on your device and send no credentials to the maintainer.
>
> When you copy the recovery key in a browser, the app tries to clear it from the clipboard after one minute, if the clipboard still holds it. Browsers can refuse that, and clipboard managers or sync may already have kept a copy.

## Website and guide

*Gate: shipped.*

> The website, guide and these policy pages at engender.barankiewicz.dev run on lh.pl hosting. The website remembers language and theme in that origin's local browser storage, separately from your journal.
>
> lh.pl keeps website access and error logs on its backup server. These logs can include IP addresses, requested URLs and browser headers.

## Page-opening counts

*Gate: shipped.*

> The website and hosted web app send one empty request when a document opens online. An online opening of a cached web app also counts. Moving between screens within the app does not send another count. Offline openings and Android do not count. Failed counts are not retried or saved for later.
>
> The request uses a fixed endpoint and sends no journal data, current page name, query string, referrer or cookies. The receiving web server necessarily sees the connection's IP address and ordinary browser headers. It removes those details before passing a fixed label, either app or website, to the self-hosted GoatCounter service. Known bots are filtered where possible.
>
> GoatCounter keeps hourly totals for those two labels, which can be viewed by day. The totals are private to the maintainer and kept indefinitely. Sessions and individual pageview storage are disabled. There are no visitor identifiers, unique-visitor counts, location or device breakdowns. Reloads count again, so these totals measure openings, not people. The dashboard's administrator login is separate from the app and uses an authentication cookie; visitors do not receive that cookie from the counter.

## Android app

*Gate: shipped.*

> Android distribution starts with APKs on GitHub. Google Play and F-Droid follow their own publication processes. A store or download service sees requests made to it and handles those under its own terms.
>
> The Android app does not request the INTERNET permission. It opens no network connections and sends nothing to any server. It also opts out of Android's cloud backup and of device-to-device transfer, so the system does not copy the app's storage to Google or to a new phone.
>
> The app opts out of WebView diagnostic uploads to Google. Google Safe Browsing stays at WebView's enabled default. Its checks can use Google Play services' own network access.
>
> Android always asks the keyboard not to learn words typed in the app, using IME_FLAG_NO_PERSONALIZED_LEARNING. The keyboard can ignore this request. It does not remove words the keyboard learned earlier. Your keyboard and browser can make their own network requests independently of engender.
>
> The app requests these permissions:
>
> POST_NOTIFICATIONS, SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM and RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED, so a reminder or the daily check-in can notify you, at the time you chose rather than in a batched system window, and still fire after the phone restarts.
>
> WAKE_LOCK, so Android can keep the CPU running while a scheduled encrypted backup is delivered to the chosen local folder. The screen can stay off.
>
> RECORD_AUDIO and MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS, for voice notes, voice practice and the sound of video notes.
>
> CAMERA, for video notes and for taking a photo. A photo is taken with your phone's camera app, and the app asks for this permission before it opens it, because Android requires that of an app that declares it.
>
> USE_BIOMETRIC and USE_FINGERPRINT, which the AndroidX biometric library adds so the app can show the system's fingerprint, face or screen lock prompt before it opens the journal. The app never sees your fingerprint or face; Android only tells it whether you were verified.
>
> Android also lists dev.engender.app.DYNAMIC_RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED_PERMISSION. It is not something the app asks of you: AndroidX declares it so that only the app itself can send its own internal messages.
>
> Reminder and check-in notifications show only a generic label by default, even on a locked screen. A setting under Notifications turns that off and shows the real title instead. If notification history is on in Android's settings, Android keeps the titles shown there for about a day after the notification goes away. The app does not turn history on and cannot clear it.
>
> When you copy the recovery key on Android 13 or later, the app marks the clipboard entry as sensitive, which asks the keyboard to leave it out of its clipboard history. The app clears the key after one minute, or when you come back if you left before then. It never clears something you copied after it.
>
> The Android journal opens in one of four ways:
>
> A key protected by Android Keystore and released after the screen lock or biometric prompt.
>
> A key protected by Android Keystore and released without a prompt. The journal is still encrypted at rest with SQLCipher.
>
> A four-digit PIN, combined with a key held in Android Keystore.
>
> A passphrase you type, turned into a key with Argon2id.
>
> Keys held in Android Keystore cannot be copied off the phone. Losing the phone or clearing the app's data makes that copy of the journal unreadable. An optional recovery key opens the journal on the same phone if unlocking fails, but cannot bring anything back once the phone or its storage is gone.

## Disguise

*Gate: shipped.*

> Disguise changes what other people can see of the app from the outside. The launcher icon and name become a neutral "Notes", and the lock screen, widgets, notifications, the names of backup and export files, printed letterheads and, on the web, the browser tab and the installed app's name stop naming engender. While disguise is on, Android also blocks screenshots and the app's preview in Recents. Once you unlock the journal, the app looks the same as without disguise.
>
> Android still shows the real name in App info, in permission prompts, in notification headers and in the widget picker. On the web, the app's address still appears in the address bar, browser history, bookmarks and site settings. Disguise is not encryption and does not change who can read the journal.

## Backups, exports and shared files

*Gate: shipped.*

> When you export or share a file, you choose where it goes. Other apps handle shared files and links and may use the network. If you save a file to a cloud drive or another document provider, that provider can see the file's name, time, size and the access logs of your account there.
>
> On Android, an unfinished manual export can leave a partial file at the chosen destination. The app keeps that file's location in private app storage until it can remove the partial file or finish the export. If the app stops during a write, it retries removal when it next starts. A provider can refuse access; the app then keeps the location for another attempt and asks you to check the destination. Clearing app storage or uninstalling also removes this record. The app cannot clean up a destination before the picker returns its location.

## Encrypted backups

*Gate: shipped.*

> An encrypted backup (.ngndr), whether you export it yourself or Android writes it on a schedule to a folder you picked, is encrypted with AES-GCM under a backup password you choose. Nobody can read it without that password.
>
> Android automatic backups require the system's local storage provider. A backup is reported complete only after the file and folder are synced and the delivered bytes are checked. The app reports incomplete delivery for other providers. It does not verify cloud uploads.
>
> If you turn on merging backups from other devices, the Android app reads that same folder when you open it. When another device has saved a newer backup there, the app opens it with the backup password and merges it into your journal on the phone. Nothing is sent anywhere; both devices only read and write the folder you picked.

## Exports meant to be read

*Gate: shipped.*

> Some exports are deliberately unencrypted because they are meant to be read, shared or printed:
>
> CSV and JSON data files exported from Settings.
>
> Keepsake journal books prepared for printing or PDF.
>
> Clinician summaries of regimens, labs, procedures, side effects and the changes you noticed, to share with a healthcare provider.
>
> Progress photo collages and timelapse videos.
>
> PDF documents exported back to your device storage.
>
> Single-event calendar files (.ics) for appointments, surgeries or the day a letter opens.
>
> Anyone who gets one of these files or a printout can read what it contains. The app asks you to confirm, or to take a deliberate step, before it writes an unencrypted file.

## Links that leave the app

*Gate: shipped.*

> The Website, Guide, Privacy policy and Source code links in About open in your browser. They lead to engender.barankiewicz.dev and github.com, which see that request like any other website would. GitHub's own privacy statement applies to pages on GitHub.

## Deleting your data

*Gate: shipped.*

> The app does not send your journal to the developer or anyone else. You can delete the local journal yourself. Support messages and hosting logs have the separate retention periods described in this policy:
>
> In the app. Settings -> Privacy & data -> Delete everything. This deletes, well, everything. If you used biometric unlock on the web, the passkey it created stays in your browser's or device's passkey list until you remove it there. It opens nothing once the journal is gone. On Android, an interrupted photo capture can leave an unencrypted file in the app’s cache. Clearing the app’s storage removes it.
>
> On Android. Uninstalling the app, or clearing its storage in the system settings, removes everything the app stored on the phone.
>
> On the web. Clearing the site data for app.engender.barankiewicz.dev in your browser removes the journal and the keys kept for it.
>
> None of these remove completed files you exported or shared, including backups written on a schedule to a folder you picked. Delete those where you saved them.

## Lost keys and passwords

*Gate: shipped.*

> The developer cannot recover a forgotten passphrase, PIN or backup password, or a lost device key or recovery key.

## Who the app is for

*Gate: shipped.*

> engender is for any trans person. There is no minimum nor maximum age for using the journal and no age-verification process.

## Support messages

*Gate: shipped.*

> If you contact engender-app@pm.me, the maintainer receives your email address, message and any attachments. These are used to answer your request. Never send a real journal, backup, password, recovery key or screenshot containing personal journal content. Support uses app and device versions, reproduction steps and invented examples instead.
>
> Private support email and downloaded copies controlled by the maintainer are deleted within 30 days after the request is resolved. Sensitive journal material sent by mistake is deleted when noticed and is not used to investigate the problem. Technical findings may remain in issue records without personal journal content. You can ask about or request deletion of correspondence through the contact address above.
>
> GitHub issues are public. Security reports use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting process. Their visibility and retention follow that service's features and policies. The maintainer cannot promise deletion from GitHub's systems, provider backups or copies held by someone else.
