  <!-- The title is the page's own name and stays that short deliberately.
       It is the one piece of metadata a reader cannot avoid: it goes into a
       browser history entry, a tab, a bookmark and the top line of a
       preview, none of which they chose. So it says the product's name, or
       on the privacy page that page's own heading, and it does not say what
       kind of app this is. An SEO pass would want "a transition journal that
       stays on your device" up here, where the words a person searches with
       carry the most weight; that is the cost, and it is paid on purpose
       (spec story 37). The description below carries those words instead,
       because no browser ever puts a description in a history entry. -->
  <title>{title}</title>
  <meta name="description" content={description} />

  <link rel="canonical" href={canonical} />
  {#each LOCALES as alternate (alternate)}
    <link rel="alternate" hreflang={alternate} href={SITE_ORIGIN + pathFor(alternate, page)} />
  {/each}
  <!-- `defaultPathFor` explains why this is the English page rather than a
       language gateway for every page: `/` asks a browser what it reads and
       sends it on, and what it detects is a language, not a page. Ticket 07
       revisited that and kept it. A per-page gateway would be a second
       redirect for every page the site grows, and pointing a reader who
       asked for the privacy page at `/` would answer them with the landing
       page in a language they never picked. -->
  <link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href={SITE_ORIGIN + defaultPathFor(page)} />

  <!-- The one tag outside the Open Graph vocabulary, and it asks for a
       layout rather than naming anybody: Twitter reads the og: tags above
       for the words and the picture, and this says which of its two card
       shapes to build. There is no site or creator handle here, because the
       project has no account anywhere to name. -->

  <!-- Structured data goes where the page describes the app, and only there.
       The privacy page describes what the app does not do, which is not a
       software listing; a breadcrumb would be markup for a trail this site
       does not show a visitor. `structuredDataScript` carries the rest of the
       reasoning, including what the vocabulary offers that this page will
       not claim. -->

<!-- No page-wide ground layer any more. Ticket 09's aurora was a fixed wash
     of drifting blobs behind everything, which is why every block of text on
     the site needed a blurred veil of --bg between it and the glow. The flag
     sun replaces it: a motif with edges, placed by the page that wants it
     (the splash's corner, the privacy page's masthead), clipped by its own
     container, and never behind running text. So the veil is gone too, and
     the contrast numbers are the palette's own again rather than something
     measured through a scrim. -->

         the site's name rather than a word like "back", so it says where it
         goes and needs no translation of its own. -->

             data-sveltekit-reload because each language is its own document:
             the language of a page is in its `<html lang>`, written when the
             file was generated, and a client-side navigation would swap the
             text while leaving that attribute - and so a screen reader's
             pronunciation - on the language the person just left. -->
