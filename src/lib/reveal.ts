/** The scroll reveals for browsers that cannot scrub them (ticket 17).
 *
 * Chromium does the whole thing in CSS, with `animation-timeline: view()` in
 * base.css, and gets it with scripting switched off. Everywhere else this
 * stands in: the same staggered arrival, driven by an IntersectionObserver,
 * with no scrubbing. Written here rather than installed, because a landing
 * page arguing that the app holds nothing back should not ship 40kb of
 * animation library to slide some paragraphs upward.
 *
 * It adds movement and never anything else. With this file blocked, never
 * loaded or simply broken, every element it would have touched is already in
 * its finished state, which is what `.reveal` styles as when nothing marks it.
 *
 * `.wipe` is picked up here too. In CSS a wipe is a clip-path uncovering a
 * card from one edge, which is a different material from the prose rise on
 * purpose; the fallback gives both the rise, because clip-path scrubbed by
 * hand on every frame is exactly the expense this file exists to avoid, and
 * an arrival that arrives is the part that carries the meaning.
